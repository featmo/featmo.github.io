      <p> 
        I still have no Idea what I want this page to be, so 
        let us consider it a work in progress.
        <br>
        I've always had an affinity for tech, it's given me the space
        to create, explore, and improve, from typing away on the family
        workstation sporting a whopping 1gb of ram, to working on VR projects
        and developing AI systems, we've come along way. 
        <br><br>
        So maybe I do know what I want this page to be, a place to share
        my thoughts, inspired mostly by <a href="https://www.songho.ca/index.html">songho's</a>
        page, this will be composed of notes, snippets, ideas, and hopefully it will
        be coherent.
        <br><br>
        <span>italktorobots<span>, because sometimes what I have to say has so much noise
        only the computer can parse it.
