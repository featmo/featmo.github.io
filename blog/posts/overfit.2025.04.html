        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
During the development of a machine learning model, data
is given to it for it to learn from, this is similar to how a person may study, one might study by revising a sample test then cross checking the answers.
Over time the model may gradually become very good at doing that particular set of tests, it may even score 100% accuracy when validated, however, the caveat is when presented with a new test and no answers, it might fail to reproduce
any usable answers. This is referred to as a <b><i>generalization</i></b> problem, or more correctly, the
model has <b><i>overfit</i></b> the data. Using the test-answer analogy, it would be similar to a student studying a particular paper, but not learning how to reason about the problem,
so when faced with a new set of problems, they begin to struggle.<br><br>
