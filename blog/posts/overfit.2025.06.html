        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
During the development of a machine learning model, data is fed into it for the purpose of training—similar to how a person studies by 
revising a test example and cross-checking the answers. Models are given sets of data: an input and the result it should produce.
Over time, the model may gradually become very good at solving that particular set of tests; it may even score <i><b>100%</b></i> accuracy when validated. 
However, when presented with a new test and no answers, it might fail to reproduce any usable outputs.
This is referred to as a <b><i>generalization</i></b> problem—or more correctly, the model has <b><i>overfit</i></b> the initial data it was trained on. 
Using the test-answer analogy, it would be similar to a student studying a particular paper without learning how to reason about the underlying topic. 
When faced with a new set of problems, they begin to struggle.
